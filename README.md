## Description

In this two-part workshop, you will experiment with different strategies and techniques for scraping data from the internet. This technique is also called "scraping". Scraped data can be later used for visualisations, investigative research, installations, sound etc.). We will examine so-called APIs and look at art projects that deal critically with data.
